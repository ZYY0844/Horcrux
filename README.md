# TiFosi

Official implementation of "TiFosi: Time-Frequency Augmentation using Spectrogram Injection for Cardiac Feature Extraction from Radar Signal" (EMBC 2025)

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding.

An example of the implementation is shown in [radarODE-MTL](https://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL), but **TiFosi** can be easily adapted to your own project with the radar spectrogram as input.
