Official implementation of "Time-Frequency Augmentation using Spectrogram Injection for Cardiac Feature Extraction from Radar Signal"

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding.

An example of the implementation is shown in [radarODE-MTL](https://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL), but H&P augmentation can be easily adapted to your own project with the radar spectrogram as input.
