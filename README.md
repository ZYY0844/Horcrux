# Spectrogram Aumentation Based on Harmonic and Percussive Components

Official implementation of H&P Augmentation

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding.

An example of the implementation is shown in [radarODE-MTL](https://github.com/ZYY0844/radarODE-MTL), but H&P augmentation can be easily adapted to your own project with the radar spectrogram as input.
